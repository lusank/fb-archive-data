 Association of Taiwan Journalists Press Release
09.45, 17 May 2018

 Press contact: Ian Chen, GS
+886-901-093-732
ianchen@atj.tw

 We the Association of Taiwan Journalists [ATJ] has learned of the UN
Secretariat's refusal of accreditation to journalists from Taiwan, whose access
to reporting on the upcoming WHA meetings in Geneva is believed to have been
denied, in direct violation of Article 19 of Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, by their nationality. We protest in the strongest term against UN's
transgression on the basic rights of Taiwanese journalists and demand full
accreditation right to be granted without discrimination. It is absurd that the
political agenda of one should be put before the well being of 7 billion people.

 Mr Philippe Leruth, the president of the International Federation of
Journalists [IFJ], called it 'unacceptable,' and said denying journalists access
to reporting on their nationality will open doors to news 'censorship.' We
welcome his remarks and appreciate him writing to the institutions responsible
for the decision to urge them to honour international media's right to cover the
annual event.

 We would also like to remind Dr Tedros that in May 2017, he said his position
is about standing up for the right of the poor. In the sense that over 23
million people in the absence of his invitation are suffering from deprivation
of representation to WHA, Taiwan is the 'poor.' Therefore he should be standing
up for their rights, not inflicting more harm by denying their journalists
access to reporting. Between that and his claim to have 'making the agency
transparent and accountable' at his top priorities, we failed to see the
harmony. Maybe there isn't any.

 Or maybe there is. We will only know for sure when journalists have the proper
accreditation and ask 'how does excluding journalists make the agency
transparent and accountable?'

 We call on all our brothers and sisters in the International Federation of
Journalists, to offer their support for press freedom and voice against UN's
decision that fosters disparity of care, one that Dr Tedors described as
'utterly unacceptable,' and urge UN to adhere to the principles it claims to
uphold.

 International Federation of Journalists Press Release

 Taiwanese journalist’s accreditation for World Health Assembly denied
17/5/2018
http://www.ifj.org/…/taiwanese-journalists-accreditation-f…/

 The accreditation for two Taiwanese journalists to cover the upcoming World
Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland has been denied. The International
Federation of Journalists (IFJ) and its affiliate the Association of Taiwan
Journalists (ATJ) have strongly criticized the move and called for the
journalists to be granted accreditation.

 The World Health Assembly, the annual meeting of the World Health Organisation
will take place in Geneva, Switzerland on May 21-26. This year, is the second
year that Taiwan has not been invited to attend the meeting, having previously
attended the annual meeting for eight years. On Monday, CNA Taiwan was told that
for the second year its journalists have been denied accreditation to cover the
meeting. The email from WHO said: “We regret to inform you that your
registration for the meeting has not been approved.""

 ATJ general secretary, Ian Chen, said: “The UN Secretariat's refusal of
accreditation to journalists from Taiwan, is in direct violation of Article 19
of Universal Declaration of Human Rights, by their nationality. We call on all
our brothers and sisters in the International Federation of Journalists, to
offer their support for press freedom and voice against UN's decision that
fosters disparity of care, one that Dr Tedors described as 'utterly
unacceptable,' and urge UN to adhere to the principles it claims to uphold.” 

 ATJ also said that denying access to Taiwan journalists questions the
transparency and accountability of the WHO.

 IFJ president, Philippe Leruth, said: ""The denial of accreditation to two of
our Taiwanese colleagues is an insidious form of censorship, as only recognized
press documents such as the International Press Card distributed the IFJ should
be the criteria to grant a professional accreditation. Besides, it is a blatant
violation of Article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which
prohibits any discrimination based on nationality. We call on the United Nations
and the World Health Organisation to ensure accreditation for all journalists
regardless their nationality to participate in the World Health Assembly and
other UN events.""

as most visible in a sharp decline in the number of “Likes” Ko has his Facebook

bringing his total “Like” count to less than two million. Ko originally had
around 2,100,000 “Likes” on Facebook. 

 Ko provoked ire after comments referring to Presidential Office

People Within the Party"" by Brian Hioe

 The internal crisis of the NPP continues, with elements of the party leadership
seemingly still uncommitted to endorsing Tsai Ing-wen of the DPP in 2020
presidential elections and continuing to flirt with the idea of nominating
former chair Huang Kuo-chang as the NPP’s presidential candidate. These
primarily seem to be older members of the NPP, suggesting an inability to
overcome generational inertia in the NPP. 

 In the meantime, the DPP is increasingly taking steps to run young candidates
in 2020 elections and appointing young people to high positions within the
party.","1571350627","https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewbloommag.net%2F2019%2F09%2F13%2Fnpp-crisis-dpp%2F&h=AT03UIQZoFg_ReS9zfPjgchyX4_m-QxbOYR13cY4Nqk2ZxKFJOnmASLb4W6yfL7IICp2t4FilF_LDCDAXg1eFOtDkyHMTKtfbNJ3vL2EciHdEvQCC2VwzIatkqx9Z8_DCFzOCxZ1kckLYGvCovj2PmkEZbLC3jQTSt5iY2o6gmMHNItWPcmzPC0qFz9AhnP6wq0wEn8WbIRdzWCgRPrAlrpHOQEH8L4gXwVg1QP6lQm80GfxSk_Wf8gD-dN2Pd89oKyyHt1ecr77ETAfqb_Zu5YjMIiSU9i2iIC1GUaG0aif5m3ACmJa2zL9m1pLhM9JRd_0PuzaHL98gCTsRdDnzTD6EVK-w9SvZtmo5RLE7O3FurDA8BFx-xXpS5mLCDgMj1eLVNgIz4DZJSz3g6QpTyL0gDFtMOIpi0slY9erXzYZ6UAW6y_mqPn9jndrwGPqCwHq_8MYpAfATgslSUHpgMWT1O6sv7XnYWL486nreWOEcVVmkRELWxl45k8wZFnm0mMZCoTh45HQ9HrPZQwQLPqTNNSyLigCQsUqS16V_0lwYScR5at7FVb_IUjuxqLPwqMTgmEhKHTY1yGcoLrzyPy41oyfDwzhxZlRQFlJ_JRnXlaY7VRkrjULsRhzqIsiS9YwtOmSMEhb94eG","https://external-frx5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAMw-c0j9E1ZJ_e&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewbloommag.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F09%2F49013972_1929858907322741_7206767484156772352_n.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_hash=AQCwqK92hG5Sy_Hx","Image may contain: one or more people, people riding bicycles, bicycle and outdoor","As the NPP’s Internal Crisis Continues, the DPP Takes Steps to Promote Young People Within the Party","The internal crisis of the NPP continues, with elements of the party leadership seemingly still uncommitted to endorsing Tsai Ing-wen of the DPP in 2020 presidential elections and continuing to fli…"

Hong Kong"" by Ting-An Lin

 With the rejection of the demands of the 2014 Umbrella Movement and the
declaration of defeat, I remember talking with some friends about Hong Kong at
the time. Our views at the time were that we admired Hong Kong protesters, but
that we were pessimistic. We were admiring of how Hong Kongers had strongly
stood up for their rights to protest, to protect their democratic freedoms. But
at the same time, we felt that there was the strong possibility that these
protests would have no means of resisting the extreme oppression of the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP).

 In observing the current protest of Hong Kongers, as well as the detention of
more than one million Uighurs in concentration camps in Xinjiang, on the one
hand, I feel a sense of rage toward the authoritarian oppression of the CCP. On
the other hand, I feel, “Is it really that in confronting totalitarian
oppression, there’s no way for us to fight back?

 Despite the narrative in international media that the Tsai administration has
offered aid to Hong Kongers seeking to settle in Taiwan, the Tsai administration
still has not taken adequate steps to provide refuge for Hong Kongers. 

 With no formal systematic process for asylum applications, it is probable that
Hong Kongers will instead turn to seeking residency in Taiwan through
investment, allowing the wealthy a means of obtaining residency in Taiwan. But
this is likely to prevent young protesters from being able to secure residency
in Taiwan, particularly at a time of stark socioeconomic inequality in Hong
Kong.","1571350630","https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewbloommag.net%2F2019%2F08%2F20%2Fhk-taiwan-asylum-process%2F&h=AT1kJTLvkUmyP8BjUfpup_x91lLUWkXU76Frp7ZoSSVtmLTrfupxjr7cBepbz8jbCSL6SGWLZwAaubZMBKjb-VYVZ2wZW5S3Y79DJ7RFwAupJT8xwdVc9aht1U8THmAj5ybo2M1G_Omgnkfjjk-xb2qnHVN5enYcbwV9cfboOI5dvpC1s0GQXTQ5f6OXDDk_4QTfz2DEee9aMn-J49SnFef1nbDqP3oEDOB_P8wkDrkxCN7zCImhV3dAZ6obBbv_yMG53yL_bL5DA5_6LmPaUktkQSxJ6V3cTfMZ1241remsK9Z4PalWlQgxPOT8WF92znORfCMM334dI18EwxbKLuwItf8HB-DLEpYozxwuwfW3FtpDciN_JkKsfw8f7EgMbbLTVK0hX9AdHkZDFP2_0TZVPNr-Qftgt0sNEVremo9m3n4dBRTAZJ8bxMLmRjO_GtX2gGQHovKYnAv8Hd-C4clb7OOGrNECyukWmMWb5Ha4KesgtOtgOdxPyehGrsF-WCSMvJoKRoGVpdGj7X4GyHekaAY6_6RZf33qalflSxRDXL7xV9Dn_BOEcnFbmqgoQYZ9kTHqEQQagXx-RBuIvg_CBgeZ4YQ8HOWbYMUbrApE_yzoUbz5rJbIv-mQIT-ekV3Z9prZiOCOjGFl","https://external-cdg2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAT_HgvpqWtcO8R&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewbloommag.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F08%2F68421693_10156388235903457_4055018824771043328_n.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_hash=AQCR2zxzpC2sLXWi","Image may contain: tree, plant, flower, outdoor and nature","With No Asylum Process, Taiwan Will Become a Refuge for Hong Kong’s Oligarchs, Not Young Protesters","Despite the narrative in international media that the Tsai administration has offered aid to Hong Kongers seeking to settle in Taiwan, the Tsai administration still has not taken adequate steps to …"

 Clashes between demonstrators and police took place outside of police stations
in Kwai Chung, Sai Wan Ho, and Tin Shui Wai in Hong Kong last night, with
demonstrators protesting the arrest of dozens of demonstrators the preceding
night. The demonstrations were not called for in advance yet took place at the
same time in three separate locations in Hong Kong, a sign of the escalating
situation in the wake of four consecutive days of protest.

 Major incidents included a police officer aiming at shotgun at protesters at
close enough range that even non-lethal rounds are thought to potentially be
fatal and individuals thought to be triad members shooting fireworks into the
crowd from a car.","1571350632","https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewbloommag.net%2F2019%2F07%2F31%2Fhk-police-station-demo%2F&h=AT0baswLTrbLNdaSFGP835adkBx-ShyL-qzTx_CNhaO4Xic6gmXRksd2MBU-JfsbIRKU92xkbYHa16dg21e_zWwSjvoE2wholwPA86jaxU-r0oelVpeZk2SXWVWsEMucP0FhVYbpYDxkr8Pot7iljD8igKWy86f9oWBgGT1cz2YU0QHH5ylmBevsQ_xlWjtQ49oyk7nmqntV3SEc8xZZy72DdINH7VDuyFYu0J1BMi1RDyaToB9GqozeHtPCP_Qu9WDhWx4Boqp7Hj3hEJ8JF2rTGSOfPdGu1PhYZcUUEXrlbovcZEK3Pgfpd3hkCbLdSiDVSGyKXG1fsrivA4fvIhMp3cYDgzq-QphnUgEKHbKUW8-UIEZimOFgqi9bHEfr81dX8kkwcv06xltffejxLSOPvQhCXEriO1ju_s4VPPBYkPdw322UYfbxt10heCuCcwVFtYmXugvoKbRRG4QggroWE0CYGDuqGtrw_3LQs2pvBDD7kBc0T71i0aAwQVaOJTcb3cRnqcRNKOwH1pwICzpttjMrXTi8zcaAKPePS0iOKGA9UFrI_d2KwKORtFUdH43uLa3PhbVz0M15NasSzcAQpL317J71eFzZ30xOtQoMjysnsh1z8SrfKpcDvVKjP7FI069fVO09dMpA","https://external-sin2-2.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQATq27DgKAs4CLu&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewbloommag.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F07%2F68321552_2248694232128000_5255175593720283136_n.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_hash=AQDMJat2NWRGk3JK","Image may contain: one or more people and people standing","Protests Erupt Outside of Hong Kong Police Stations in Response to Sunday’s Arrests","Clashes between demonstrators and police took place outside of police stations in Kwai Chung, Sai Wan Ho, and Tin Shui Wai in Hong Kong last night, with demonstrators protesting the arrest of dozen…"

 Have you ever seen a YoungBong or Juu4E music video? If you’re reading this,
probably not. These low-budget yet extremely popular videos consist of heavily
tattooed members of the Thai underclass messing around to hip hop/trap music
shot in $10 a night hotels. They rack up millions of views and, to casual
observers and fans alike, these artists speak to a fun sense of nihilism and
rejection of participation in mainstream Thai society.

by Brian Hioe

 Much attention as of late has been focused on Chinese efforts to influence
Taiwanese media through either directly channeling funds into Taiwanese media
outlets or spreading disinformation. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the
KMT had long conducted such manipulation of the media in Taiwan, well before the
Internet age, by drawing on traditional clientelist networks. This is visible in
unresolved scandals in Hualien regarding former county commissioner Fu Kun-chi.

Government on Framing of LegCo Invasion"" by Brian Hioe

 What should be self-apparent is that in the aftermath of the brief occupation
of LegCo in Hong Kong Monday, a discursive battle is currently being fought
between pro-democracy activists and government officials regarding the framing
of the occupation attempt. Hong Kong government officials have, unsurprisingly,
attempted to depict activists as a violent and irrational mob. 

 On the other hand, pro-democracy activists have pointed to the fact that
demonstrators were pushed into taking an extreme form of action because of the
refusal of the government to back down, that demonstrators were not violent, and
that there is no comparing the physical violence used against peaceful
demonstrators by riot police to property damage within LegCo.","1571350636","https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewbloommag.net%2F2019%2F07%2F03%2Flegco-occupation-framing-battle%2F&h=AT2HxaZz3-UmDPGL_N8oN-JAPO5jMKmqODFpekmqfVvDiS4AOuGzUF1e-i7kX_qzxNeWEurEglV-l4I2ijitD8Sz7jA0QsrteXb95TStoyGMJPVe88UDd2Pn_slggD2tRf66TcxSq0SyaHD8hhZ8QMjkp-v64J_TvNEaLPTIg7NyBk_dAsEnHVHli1SrJ8kzFeE44eFeCf6NlN4Yy8CqLzG8qjI3nFaeclBVhmjSddHEcMjJJ1_zN5JEUW1YiERR15bThfiy1eolCTQHlFqsZr4J1aKu43mrASMbjaA-PsfDF8-sM7Mq9iA7T0z0VvXki24IbGNjF_6UGHQTNj8xlICjlY8gEZDaKPfglLeilYWaRGauX-oNehxbnuJiHLzB4agymmUwNsHjbDH9KvicQeS3gAGg6dNYGiPU-F1bJ5NVT4mkmAc1_rWJM3idBkK6COF8Sb9zqExBKw4ZNbsOVmg0L_rJ96P4olLWxXKj37RI9GXHU3nGtlfXYn_LHWOvz-XLi_tyVK8OcPiaYduMv4gn84ENk1I9dbm9bjzBbUbKMd_JcrdhtZeNK3dVKEaOO020s9aqtCZvSYrkQvgPbpc01AJaYqSm9RzKaHSKBNAE0LFj91pknDwmjQSoAVTsDkE83y5-T3tE2ACm","https://external-cdt1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCItBXJ5GDsBci0&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewbloommag.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F07%2F20190701_protest_cy_06.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_hash=AQDh7ZjDqpdkeTNr","Image may contain: one or more people and crowd","Discursive Struggle Breaks out Between Democracy Activists and Hong Kong Government on Framing of Legco Invasion","What should be self-apparent is that in the aftermath of the brief occupation of LegCo in Hong Kong Monday, a discursive battle is currently being fought between pro-democracy activists and governm…"

announced that individual tours to Taiwan from 47 cities across China will come
to a halt starting on August 1st. 

 Second, reports have emerged of Chinese troops amassing on the border between

 自2014年雨傘革命的運動訴求被拒、宣布失敗以來，當跟朋友聊到香港，獲得的回應常是「敬佩但悲觀」 — —
既敬佩香港人展現之堅毅抵抗威權、守護民主自由的精神，但同時又覺得即使有這些抵抗，最終或許也無法抵擋中國共產黨的強勢壓制。

 
最近看著香港人民的抗爭、看著新疆維吾爾族被送進集中營，一方面對於中國政府的極權壓迫覺得憤怒，另一方面，更想知道的是：「面臨這樣的極權統治，難道人民真的一點機會都沒有嗎？」

 
抱持著這樣的疑問，搜尋了一些跟非暴力抗爭相關的資訊，閱讀後獲得了一些心得、一些樂觀，也有隨之而來的其他疑惑。不過若要用一句話總結心得，大概會是：「即使是面對中國這樣的獨裁政府，人民依然是有希望進行反抗、走向民主的。而這樣的希望並非僅是在等待奇蹟發生，而是於理有據、於歷史有前例可循。」

 把一些初步的想法寫在這裡簡單分享，歡迎更多的討論與指教。

 希望這些討論可以讓更多人民獲得思想的彈藥，也希望思想的彈藥能成為行動的重要補給。","1571350637","https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewbloommag.net%2F2019%2F08%2F01%2Ftw-hk-dictatorship-democracy%2F&h=AT0xrC1YVTS0-Rzy6sW8jot-nfQDZ-nEL7u8-S11Hoc0_FsAKlhHDrc8S03wx7GOC8WSc0bUUvYSqpYWVakErlRrSc0FMgjVCaYMvFBfQvnQXxRGAApa3YJUi0f9cPXUidaXJRuUckLSn4B7EKd6DKba30p9Qnw9sODQXfEqKxAvHdUTkWm4U8xteeKsqKMkf4np8ha3XLN6aM7QDZAzfZrVBzHH5EjD9ofKUwpXtdA2_v5fQa1LlDw1QN37czajpSb7z-OfNvM4t-KOu1E0oqhnDzDfpMXmRmN4AtCYQMATVlHwlIFrVmPM-yiIyA7eWdo5B4p3vbjD979oHjCsmeMIDGWO26UJ2O4xbin45Zriao45udPrL1p9bx3WTKCrOHJjxjeObtIYI5Jks6Syu6hUUXKuJ9OWT3tQCO85arzWdU3IGnCENZU-SdxmMe1wxkGiKdK-4MzqnmZnnB1TattF0_x6-qW6OKkgLYTLO9m17U4h4JBdiPZG9VuCePMgQloSERRnB4T8fbsvsZOdnpK2R0I_fDU_YkqkqQ1Wf_QtateI7xwoo8Aj2cOzdmGJm18kS700CeJvryjxeDPVTxdIEtyzA5rPICIEGC_zHbHSL6UPJfp7QLMKWl4JxpranGcVAxwLqJXJCVCv","https://z-p3-external.fpnh5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQATXZCHQ3SZD4on&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewbloommag.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F08%2FIMG_6788.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_hash=AQD6xEYT9LAkyM8I","Image may contain: one or more people, crowd and outdoor","如何從獨裁走向民主？ — — 從香港看非暴力抗爭對抗獨裁政權的可能性","自2014年雨傘革命的運動訴求被拒、宣布失敗以來，當跟朋友聊到香港，獲得的回應常是「敬佩但悲觀」 — — 既敬佩香港人展現之堅毅抵抗威權、守護民主自由的精神，但同時又覺得即使有這些抵抗，最終或許也無法抵擋中國....."

 Taiwan's lack of any formal asylum policy—with no formalized process for
processing applications by asylum seekers—is likely to be tested in the near
future, with the Apple Daily reporting that thirty Hong Kong protesters have
fled to Taiwan in the aftermath of the attempted occupation of LegCo on July
1st. According to the Apple Daily, another wave of more than thirty Hong Kong
protesters is considering fleeing to Taiwan in the near future.

 In May, the Taiwanese government seemed at a loss as to how to handle just five
asylum seekers in Taiwan. With possibly up to sixty or more asylum seekers from
Hong Kong in the near future, the likelihood of the Taiwanese government
bungling matters is quite high.","1571350643","https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewbloommag.net%2F2019%2F07%2F20%2Fhk-asylum-seekers-wave%2F&h=AT2whE0ZQ15S5t_chA3m3A2Hnh8wjBsY2hpIFWQ-nIa59cYWkCVlOOJBMFdi22l5JoiL-QIZw5CBYUhm9_8tkvj620UOZEl4XzuMkB-zrxhi6mMRW4F6bDe_xxW-3xgNMy2-tEDvGMg9x9nL6rpHhRSztCtjCBSMCY68fKZc8-N_9mQbioc0orpEAJBmiMZk2YRVA1MxNwo5UG11ttZ9klpJuiG9794Mte95ZSMKFDBBhgC8SIHHWKjHj3XJgGeLoejkSn_14x0nvvgLrvUo1iuMJjYfIsdRvzHZd_23lWN4ZIbBCSG3gGobLuvp22AWL2LVE3Ha3oXYJ-TE5ySRb7ozsyXEkZ8hp5UQjbNz2QNNSSR3hSMukxsTyeOlq2akQt_HlTNe2_iTvdYVxj_Pw3onpVKTrQD1s1qihc7xc7Y5oSdVxa4O_FobngHv3TEm9T3Bw49e31Oh_0eOjWZP6WwjJB-sxcW4EGt4IiSSKnPNH1sIgWA0T-Tz2PG0ilXPL17IayUNY5rRdgZFNJWA4QVuDfTg-sAvweabh-Kf8wMN-GCGEOOEXhufJFukyB4ZZ1CQeHw9UtGNvI3iTEd_bkLY6MYFKSnZ25T7ObRHOz5WKK3txGdiC3FkGpgZ_jXqd6iePcujGZHktyZV","https://external.fjnb10-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDYHSRR1h0D5o6l&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewbloommag.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F07%2FIMG_7066.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_hash=AQBHdHuRUNOOf_dL","Image may contain: one or more people, crowd, skyscraper, sky and outdoor","Swift Action from the Tsai Administration Needed Regarding Hong Kong Asylum Seekers","Taiwan’s lack of any formal asylum policy—with no formalized process for processing applications by asylum seekers—is likely to be tested in the near future, with the Apple Daily reporting th…"

by Brian Hioe

 Ko Wen-je's Taiwan People’s Party may be the largest uncertain factor after the
results of the 2020 elections, seeing as the party is a newly emergent political
force.

 In examination of the TPP’s five legislators, who are they? The TPP’s five
legislators are revealing of a primarily pro-business, technocratic orientation
for the party—which may not surprise, given Ko’s claims to put aside politics to
focus on effective administrative management of Taipei. But despite the TPP’s
claims to be beyond pan-Blue and pan-Green political distinctions, the TPP’s
political orientation ultimately slants toward the pan-Blue camp.",1579286112,"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewbloommag.net%2F2020%2F01%2F14%2Ftpp-five-legislators%2F&h=AT1kRTbLyI9AOSEWzmPw2TGd3ueNSpELgmu-E8puLG1ehuzVXMF3Yhsu8pd1PAAzgOzoXYUx0-CVHAdS6Psv5Sa3GY2lu3pmj0Fyc4Mi33cSq1z5_DPjTTf5EFaYsgP6x630a07V8XI13LVqKQp8YIPm20HxDt68BxjP9GDB47bqyx-uM2mHjvPxWppM5cMgO0JzV6GiDyK9YwaviPzU34aVxxm7oqd3eQbEn2x3rCXrfSiU1W2YvQwI944ynDLw3iGpUY1Ej8Rj8ItbaZH0zoX6w0yDTg7qJCiO6CigH4cPy7zunEs1x-hxwcK3dbc-Pyaq1Tx-Vk5P-B1FVRbWME2ojFsgbBnIIg6sWpGVr61bHZrCNIBbbr_SWMlArORfWcq2GQV4NOPj76MQBHMiLWVLyIxQgjHuW3kCxjrS9wPtnKXIZ1cwIhIR3LrEEBVFnBpGX5wA_3pdTcw6E-J9gY-72M2fCP8MGpwI3MLBQRYzVaC24uuAsLSv3TAfD6XIL_A-EDSW7xTRF9Lln0tiaaDkIi9ETEQBXAncCz1tZ8N3hq940K-5jzcCarV5MsKDmeX1O3L28KzuOT924BJ9qcLgzbVawWtkrJYPHHEax8O55LwXodZEIhpCJeHiT5NkyzvubO-8P8ExUY7J","https://external.fbkk10-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAUZ5ce5DnNO0R1&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewbloommag.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2F81963019_2635501566528607_8632531167108661248_o.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_hash=AQCvpvsoeNJnPsUB","ในภาพอาจจะมี หนึ่งคนขึ้นไป, ฝูงชน และ สถานที่กลางแจ้ง","Ko Wen-je’s Taiwan People’s Party may be the largest uncertain factor after the results of the 2020 elections, seeing as the party is a newly emergent political force…","newbloommag.netThe TPP’s Five Legislators Are Illustrative of the Party’s Pan-Blue Leanings | New Bloom MagazineKo Wen-je’s Taiwan People’s Party may be the largest uncertain factor after the results of the 2020 elections, seeing as the party is a newly emergent political force…Ko Wen-je’s Taiwan People’s Party may be the largest uncertain factor after the results of the 2020 elections, seeing as the party is a newly emergent political force…"

China，即台灣）國旗，突然被移到了香港國旗旁。在此前，中華民國國旗一直與其他國家的國旗，依字母順序並列在所有旗幟中。此外，在羅徹斯特大學的網站上，學校官方先是創造了一個既具創意又令人疑惑的類別「次國家」，並將台灣和香港歸類其下，然在遭受各方抗議後將其改為「特殊自治區和其他地區」（「次國家」一詞在11月20日仍存於其URL鏈接）。後於11月21日，羅徹斯特大學似乎採取的妥協解決方案是將所有國旗分為「聯合國認可的國家」和「其他國家和地區」，並將台灣和香港置於「其他國家和地區」之下。奇怪的是，儘管科索沃（Kosovo）和台灣一樣沒有被聯合國認可，其網站仍將科索沃列在「聯合國認可的國家」之下，這樣的做法不禁令人懷疑背後的動機？",1579286115,"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewbloommag.net%2F2020%2F01%2F17%2Fur-flag-relocation-zh%2F&h=AT1iFlz5Q8j19qh-BMTitiOBw6QocaDANSrmeyWA03n715ojhgW2yG_c1aEWF1UlhYWLnz-0_PAL2B9_iFCraSkW9IkcMrWcKQ1TnBHz41riH04PpR_681h9uz8jtCY2P1MvXgXqIIokwowI8_7FkX1DMfXgu_HQyqxoaWLRBk4Kn2TPtkvkWN9dx7uIbkmb8xgaLGVLpMO8-Mx1DDEYyrPIXqa1WFn7VLkxihILdhMYLlQGpQmfkBfvSMU5l1KQ62rk7cfD1GjEhif-bsNnciz2vhhh-zMRFqTu2Mow4KDIywTZQSvjTSoybamauk65gYnPuNXPeQ4XNU0upnso294ReKMDM-eSPkqOFhHRUBIvLGSPyRv-Yl-xND0NDG34roFuap6XLXpLjX1S_-8sF3F1EHtnL-Abo9EQgd_azGzH240JWxykORhJS6zNKCtlE8pAge3OtH5U20YXsqMh7guKdWRooS_DeicIU0psRC-87CMvg866iJpCygwirWmO6mEOEws7c2hdt7p4PwR8a7j3Te9nDvr213hCjPGCkoIHcomnOIf5Vl9pM00l37P6aWvMDwX-f6Pcduo33aUeg4QNpx0083wIn1-HJ-GHAYRm7VNz2vgHUfXqHPZnwZBfpCNLdudPnD7ooS_p","https://external-cgk1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDaNiTtgExMueq4&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewbloommag.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2FCampus_view_at_the_University_of_Rochester.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_hash=AQBP2EEMz_2O6VZf","Image may contain: one or more people, tree, plant, shoes, sky, house, outdoor and nature","在此形勢下，資本主導的美國大學如何處理對中共所謂「敏感問題」的敘述？什麽又是教育工作者應該關心的？","newbloommag.net美國大學中的中國影響：從羅徹斯特大學事件說起 | New Bloom Magazine在此形勢下，資本主導的美國大學如何處理對中共所謂「敏感問題」的敘述？什麽又是教育工作者應該關心的？在此形勢下，資本主導的美國大學如何處理對中共所謂「敏感問題」的敘述？什麽又是教育工作者應該關心的？"

 New Bloom and Indie DaDee will be holding an election livestream from 6:30 PM

討論題目包括過去一年來國民黨的突然復甦，以及它在近幾個月內同樣出人意表的支持度下跌，還有太陽花運動後青年參政的現況，創新的選戰行銷，等等。我們將陳述以上這些及其他議題，並更新及時開票結果，還會請到幾位特別來賓。

 Among the topics we will be discussing include the sudden resurgence of the KMT
in the past year and its equally surprising decline in approval ratings in the
past few months, the current state of post-Sunflower Movement youth politics,
innovative campaign advertising, and more. We will be featuring presentations on
these topics and others, providing live updates on the election, and will also
have a number of special guests.

that he had been paid by the DPP to do so. On the other hand, if Wang refused to

 破土與音地大帝將在明天晚上六點半到九點半舉行大選現場的Livestream廣播！

 New Bloom and Indie DaDee will be holding an English-language election
livestream from 6:30 PM to 9:30 PM tomorrow! 

 
討論題目包括過去一年來國民黨的突然復甦，以及它在近幾個月內同樣出人意表的支持度下跌，還有太陽花運動後青年參政的現況，創新的選戰行銷，等等。我們將陳述以上這些及其他議題，並更新及時開票結果，還會請到幾位特別來賓。

 Among the topics we will be discussing include the sudden resurgence of the KMT
in the past year and its equally surprising decline in approval ratings in the
past few months, the current state of post-Sunflower Movement youth politics,
innovative campaign advertising, and more. We will be featuring presentations on
these topics and others, providing live updates on the election, and will also
have a number of special guests. 

 敬請鎖定！我們將在臉書粉絲頁上廣播，到時請留意我們的粉絲頁！

 Stay tuned! We will be broadcasting on Facebook, so keep your eyes on our
