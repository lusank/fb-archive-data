Solomon Islands -- on Monday. Rumors of a break in ties had been swirling ever
since the nation’s pro-China prime minister took office in April. The move
brings Taiwan’s diplomatic allies down to 16. 

 In today’s Taiwan Insider, we hear from a former ambassador to the Solomon
Islands, Victor Yu, who weighs in on the break in ties. Plus, Natalie Tso
explains why US Senator Marco Rubio and others are pushing the TAIPEI Act, which
would enable the US to downgrade ties with countries that break ties with
Taiwan.

 In our top news this week, hosts Andrew Ryan and Natalie Tso give a background
to the LGBTQ rights and same-sex marriage debate in Taiwan, where the
legislature passed a draft bill this week to legalize same-sex marriage. Rights
guaranteed by the draft bill, titled “The Enforcement Act of Judicial Yuan
Interpretation No. 748,” include property inheritance rights, medical decisions
rights, and adoption rights for the biological children of a same-sex spouse.
Foreign nationals are excluded from the bill.

 To celebrate Women’s Day, we also have an interview with two inspiring female
entrepreneurs, Mae O’Malley, founder of Paragon Legal (San Francisco, CA) and
Vivian Chiang, a co-founder at Orbit Baby and Speed Smith (Delaware, US).

Taiwan? 

 So far, just this year, 40 Taiwanese companies have relocated from China back
to Taiwan, contributing to Taiwan’s national export numbers. Although exports to
China have dropped, exports to the US have jumped. Foreign investment in Taiwan
is also on the rise, increasing 31% last year as Taiwan tries to re-establish
itself as a go-to place for foreign high tech investment free from Chinese
tariffs and data security concerns.

campus is a US$255 million investment. 

 In a 2018 press release on the dedication of the new compound, AIT said this
was “an expression of the values of American democracy, and a demonstration of
respect for Taiwan.” Ms. Mansour reiterated in this interview that the new

that were about Taiwan, a place where she was born, where her parents were from,
and where she visited every summer. As an adult, Kathy has moved to Taiwan and
has just written a children’s book about the city she now calls “hometown.” 

 In this interview, Kathy Cheng talks about her inspirations for making the
book, the process of crowdfunding in Taiwan, and the positive responses she has
received from Taiwanese readers as well as from the Taiwanese diaspora around
the world.

 Kathy is a Taipei-based writer also known as Tricky Taipei. She also runs a
series of events called Tricky Talks. You can purchase “Hey Taipei” at

million Hong Kongers hit the streets last Sunday in what some say was the
largest protest the city’s ever seen. It was a continuation and extension of
public outcry over a Chinese extradition bill. This week also saw an apology
from Hong Kong’s chief executive, who has suspended, but failed to withdraw the
bill. 

 In today’s show, we hear from a Hong Kong bookseller who escaped to Taiwan and
has some pretty strong words for the public. 

 Taiwan, on the other hand, has made some major changes to the way it holds
referendums. That’s after a public outcry last year over long wait times at the
ballot box. In today’s Taiwan Explained, we’ll detail how the changes will
affect future elections.

president. But who will run against President Tsai Ing-wen, who has already
fought off a challenger from within her own Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
to win the nomination? All eyes are on the Kuomintang (KMT) primaries which will
be decided by polls next week, and which of the five candidates for the
nomination will rise to the top. 

 Will it be pro-China populist Han Kuo-yu, who is stirring up huge rallies, but
facing calls for his resignation barely six months into his term as mayor of
Kahosiung? Will it be the richest man in Taiwan, Foxconn founder Terry Gou,
whose company makes your iPhone? Or will it be the establishment pick: Eric Chu,
who is a popular former mayor of New Taipei City, but who lost the 2016 election
to Tsai?

 In this week’s Taiwan Insider, Natalie Tso and Andrew Ryan offer a closer look
at the top KMT candidates and explain how both Taiwan’s largest political
parties have changed their primary process. We also hear from political analyst
Courtney Donovan Smith about the China policies of the top KMT contenders.

television and the internet this week; we’ve got Hong Kong on our mind. 

 Today’s Taiwan Insider takes a deep dive into the story that launched the
largest protests that Hong Kong has seen since its handover to China in 1997. It
may seem like this story is taking place far away, but you’ll want to hear how
it’s connected not only to Taiwan, but to anyone who passes through the city. 

 We’ll explain the proposed law which would allow extradition of people from
Hong Kong to China, and why that’s a concern to many. Also, find out about the
brutal murder case in Taiwan that prompted the push for the law, and hear how
Taiwan’s presidential candidates responded to the unrest.
