 Victor Wu, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Vpon, shared his
entrepreneurial experience on starting and running a big data company since 2008
with highly enthusiastic undergraduates interested in embarking on their journey
in the digital industry which was held at the National Taiwan University.

 Victor pointed out that entrepreneurs don’t need a specific expertise to
succeed but the first thing to look for is problem solving. ""Entrepreneurial
Spirit” is one of the core components that Victor encourages the team in Vpon to
experience through trial and error in order to nurture entrepreneurship. Great
entrepreneurs count for nothing if they aren’t a risk taker and a winning
character. 

 At Vpon, talents are definitely the company's greatest asset. We are always
committed to look for the bold soul who despite the threat of failure but prefer
greater steps inside to pursue greatness. Every year, we organize a two-month
Vorch summer internship programme as part of our wider initiatives in nurturing
youth and developing talent and we welcome young individual talents to join us.

using digital channels? 】

 Vpon APAC held its latest breakfast seminar – “How to succeed in reaching
Chinese Travellers using digital channels?” at Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong

 Everybody says this is an era of AI-First, while Big Data is the nutrient for
Artificial Intelligence. Without its nourishment, AI will be unable to play its
best role. However, mastering massive data but lacking the leading-edge
technology fails to turn big data into actionable insights. AI and big data are
like couple with an indispensable relationship – closely related and mutually
reinforcing. With this in mind, we do not only uphold “Data Drives Transactions”
as our core mission, but also value Human Intelligence to bring about Collective
Intelligence. 

 ✅To Vpon, we say this is an era of A+B+C.

 We believe an A (Artificial Intelligence) + B (Big Data) + C (Collective
Intelligence) Formula achieves the most effective marketing performance for
advertisers💰, leading the industry to grow and expand. Yet, as an Asia’s
leading big data ad tech company, we aim higher and do more. 

 Besides celebrating our 🔟th anniversary with all of you, we wish to make
contribution to society and be answerable to public support upon our unique
Vpon’s culture 🤝. In the past 10 years, Vpon has constantly been promoting
“Entrepreneurial Spirit”, “Openness” and “Give-and-Take” as the backbone of our
company culture. The world changes alongside with technology every day, while
Vpon has followed closely with the pace of the world’s development – accepting
new things and innovations with “Openness”, taking up new challenges with
“Entrepreneurial Spirit”, and finally, employing our “Give-and-Take” vision to
give back to society with our achievements.

 We truly believe our culture helps establish a virtuous circle🔃to push every
aspect of our society’s development forward. Thus, our 10-year celebration will
stick with these three elements as our themes, including charity events, talent
training and recruitment, providing ample opportunities and a conductive
workplace for younger generations, as well as caring and supporting those in
need. 

 Wishing Vpon a happy anniversary and more ten-years to come. 🎊

effectiveness of your ad campaign as well as spending. Served impression refers
to the number of times of your ad being delivered but not necessarily being
viewed, because not all impressions are viewable. Viewable impressions are those
ads that appear at least 50% on screen for more than one second.

 Vpon is now collaborating Integral Ad Science (IAS) to provide advertisers with
a way to track their ad campaign’s impressions independently through a third
party.

 Vpon today announced that the company is now officially certified in the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Tech Lab Open Measurement Software
Development Kit (OM SDK) initiative. New update is expected to be launched by
the end of August. It simplifies and adds efficiency to the process that had
previously involved with numerous SDKs across different advertisers using
different third parties while everyone can benefit from using only one shared
SDK for easy ad verification and viewability measurement purpose. 

 “We are honored to receive the OM SDK certification from IAB Tech Lab, enabling
Vpon to provide more measurable supply and increase greater transparency which
makes it beneficial for both advertisers and publishers. At our core, we truly
believe that our goal is to support the sustainable development of the industry,
and with the adoption of the OM SDK, we continue our mission to build a better
industry,” said Vpon’s Chief Operating Officer, Arthur Chan.

Startup Delegation to Japan” co-organized by Deloitte and Asia America
Multi-Technology Association (AAMA) Cradle Program, to share with business
investors about Vpon’s successful showcase in building business opportunities

 AAMA is committed to strengthen business connections and promoting business

to grow and learn. Seven Taiwanese enterprises were invited this year to share
how they have tapped into the Japan market with invaluable experience of
investment and business cooperation. 

 Shino shared Vpon’s experience in leveraging its advanced data analytical
techniques and professional data strategy consultation to offer diversified and
comprehensive data solutions for Japan agencies such as Japan National Tourism
Organization and Osaka Tourism Board, which has successfully helped Vpon tapping
into the tourism industry in Japan. 

 It was such an honor to be invited to the event hosted by AAMA along with other
delegates. We believe that, by sharing our story, we were able to help
strengthen the bridge built by the pioneers for the others to come. To know more

tourists is the key ... the ad message has to be straightforward and impactful,

 Our Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Victor Wu has honorably participated
at the Global Initiatives Symposium in Taiwan (“GIS Taiwan”) which was held in
National Taiwan University today. As being one of the inspiring speakers at the
symposium, Victor shared his entrepreneurial journey about the necessary skills
he learnt from school in applying into the real world while he also discussed
with youngsters on how they can prepare well with the desire to build, create
and learn in facing their upcoming challenges in the future. 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️

 Victor believed that it’s necessary to share his valuable time and inspiring
experience with youngsters which are critical in training future leaders. He
also began this journey with the hope of starting something he could leave
behind for the next generation to continue, which echoes with Vpon’s
give-and-take culture. 

 Global Initiatives Symposium in Taiwan invites top-notch speakers from
political, business and academic sectors with lively exchanges among speakers to
discuss and engage with youngsters to explore the development potential in

development of global cross-border marketing

 Full article: https://goo.gl/tiiS1R

 Cross-border tourism development is booming, as international tourism has
continued to grow for six consecutive years since 2015. The number will keep
increasing over at least the next ten years. A statistic indicated that there
were almost 1.2 billion international tourists in 2015, and it is expected to
reach 18 billion by 2030.

 In 2015, Chinese tourists were the world's top spenders in international
tourism receipts with spending around US$ 290 billion, which is approximately
equivalent to Singapore's GDP. 95% of Chinese tourists brought smartphones while
travel, and 80% of these people said that they used the mobile apps to arrange
itineraries. This behavior of highly dependent on the smartphones is the key to
the vigorous development of big data, also the basis for companies to master the
cross-border marketing business opportunities.

 Some people said, ""Get mobile data, then you get the world."" Compared to
computers, smartphones collect more personalized and comprehensive online user
behavior effectively, so it is easier to build a big database and receive data.
With this stable foundation, the artificial intelligence can have in-depth and
accurate understanding of the habits and preferences of international travelers
in three different stages of tourism (pre-trip, during-trip, and post-trip) by
analyzing the data, and to create a better conversion rate for brands.

 More importantly, these data are not one-off or one-way, which change through
continuous tracking and interaction. With accurate audience tags added in the
data management platform (DMP), Vpon has more comprehensive understanding for
each international tourist, and the retargeting also comes into being.

 Vponers went for team outing last weekend in Tamsui Taipei to not only discover
the native Taiwanese cultural landmarks with its magnificent architecture but
also participated in scavenger hunt to find the treasures along the Tamsui
riverside and Old Street. It was a fun team building activity that use the
intelligence and creativity of each Vponer to bring out the best in the group. 

 The Super Saturday Treasure Hunting gave the Vponers a great opportunity to
build trust bridges between team members and to focus on building a culture of
excellence. We believe, here in Vpon, by creating a positive work environment
where employees feel valued, more innovative ideas can be unleashed.

cardholders] 

 Our Chief Operating Officer, Arthur Chan, has been featured in a recent
exclusive interview with TechOrange to share his insights on the common
traditional digital marketing approach that clients often adopt to reach its
defined target audience. Like many aspects of marketing, it involves a lot of
resources in the repeated trial and error process resulting in significant
increase in marketing cost and eventually decrease labor efficiency. Clients
should begin adopting the use of Big Data analytics in defining the right
audience segment and make better business decision which ultimately enable
continuous business growth. 

 With our continuous in-depth co-operation with our valued client, Citibank,
Vpon was able to collect data from their official website across different
product lines (which effectively replace CRM data source) and integrate with
Vpon’s proprietary DMP database to analyze and predict behavioural patterns of
Citibank existing cardholders. We continuously leverage Big Data to identify
existing cardholders and expand through lookalike modeling, as a result, CPA and
CPL have largely been lowered demonstrating the importance of developing its own
data bond segment to gain actionable insights for devising long-term marketing
strategies.
