grateful for my partnership with One Day's Wages and Eugene Cho . Every year, I
donate my 'one game's wage' and am committed to learning (and doing something)
about the complex issues of poverty. Im extremely inspired by their vision...
that every day people can join together to empower those living in poverty. Join
us!!

competition is mental toughness.

being from Palo Alto - the greatest city in the world, as far as I’m concerned.
Like many others, I read ""The Silicon Valley Suicides"" in this month’s Atlantic
and it led me to reflect on my own experience at Palo Alto High School.

 http://theatln.tc/1NY7nlK

 The pressure to succeed in high school is all too familiar to me. I distinctly
remember being a freshman in high school, overwhelmed by the belief that my GPA
over the next four years would make or break my life. My daily thought process
was that every homework assignment, every project, every test could be the
difference. The difference between a great college and a mediocre college. The
difference between success and failure. The difference between happiness and
misery.

 I remember not being able to sleep well on Sunday nights, waking up covered in
sweat from nightmares that I had just failed a test. I dreaded Sundays because
it meant I just finished my weekend basketball tournament - my precious outlet
from academics - and now faced a whole week of immense pressure at school. I
felt the pressure coming from all around me - my parents, my peers and worst of
all, myself. I felt that I had one shot at high school and that my GPA, SAT
score and college applications were the only barometers of my success.

 One day, I remember attending a panel discussion where a college student was
asked, ""What is your biggest regret from high school?"" Expecting to hear about
opportunities missed or paths not taken, I was surprised when the student
replied, ""My biggest regret is not enjoying high school more and thinking that
my grades and test scores mattered so much. In fact, I don’t even remember what
I scored on the SATs."" I had filled out more Princeton Review practice test
Scantrons than I could count and one day, I wouldn’t even remember my SAT
score?!? 

 As each year of high school passed by, I realized that even though there was
pressure to be great, I had to make a personal choice not to define myself by my
success and accomplishments. I learned through my brother, my pastor and my
friends that my identity and my worth were in more than my grades. Growing up my
parents always said, ""Do your best and trust God with the results."" When I
learned to truly understand what that meant, it was like a weight had been
lifted off my shoulders. 

 Separating myself from my results is not an easy lesson and I’ve had to relearn
this in every stage of my life. The world will always need you to accomplish
more, do more, succeed more. After I got into Harvard there was the pressure to
get good grades and stand out at Harvard. After Linsanity there was the pressure
to have great performances every night, to become an All-Star, to win
championships. I still dream big and give my all in everything I do, but I know
that success and failure are both fleeting.

 When I was a freshman at Palo Alto High, a classmate who sat next to me
committed suicide. I remember having difficulty registering what had happened. A
year later, a friend committed suicide. I saw up close the pain and devastation
of their loved ones and in my community. I realized then that there are so many
burdens we don’t see the people around us carrying. I told myself that I would
try to be more sensitive and open to other people's struggles. 

 We may not have the answers to how to completely solve these issues, but we can
take more time to really listen to each other, to reach out and have compassion
on one another. I don’t have any great insight and I don’t know exactly what
it’s like to be a high school student today. I do know that I’m proud to be from
Palo Alto, a resilient community that I see striving to learn how to better
support and care for each other. I hope that my personal experience can remind

"https://www.facebook.com/jeremylin7/posts/1890717417829524","1485198929","By now the news has been released that I’ve retweaked my hamstring a third time.
Although this is the least severe of the three, this third injury has been a
hard one to deal with mentally. There’s something so draining about the yo-yo
effect of going from injured to healthy to injured to healthy that in some ways
it would have been easier to have an injury where I knew from the beginning I
would be out for a long, set amount of time.

 There are few things more humbling for an athlete than an injury. They are a
reminder that as much as we would like to be, we are not in control of our lives
and careers. Cheering from the sidelines and being limited to only using my
speech, instead of my body, has shown me how I've taken my health for granted.

 People may ask if I rushed back. I can confidently say I didn’t. I checked
every single check box that needed to be checked before returning and progressed
carefully through my rehabs. The reality is that even when we plan for things to
go a certain way, sometimes God has other plans.

 Of course I have all the natural emotions that comes with an injury. Some
moments I feel super motivated. Some moments I feel defeated. Some moments I
want to yell at God in frustration. Why now? Why not when I was a backup point
guard the last 4 years? All the hard work I put into training, developing a new
shot, regaining my confidence, having my desired role, the right coach and the
right system. A year of my prime down the drain. These are the natural thoughts
that float into my mind, get kicked out, and float back in.

 But I’ve been here before. I’ve faced lows and seen how God has led me out of
them. I’m quicker to gain perspective and remember His sovereignty and ability
to turn my setbacks into life lessons and opportunities. Don’t get me wrong,
injuries still suck. There’s nothing more I want than to be on the court,
fighting with my team. Losing is hard. Wearing blazers every night gets old. 

 I’ve been thinking a lot recently of Ava Bright Lee, a little girl I had the
privilege of getting to know who went to be with God this year after a long
battle with cancer. My situation is NOTHING like hers, yet she lived with
supernatural joy through adversity. Her mom, Esther, writes beautifully and
honestly about their journey. Of Ava’s life she wrote this:

 “She had scar upon scar, procedure upon procedure, pain upon pain, and she
faced it all...with a smile. Since the day she was born she began teaching me
truths about living and loving and hoping. It's not because she was perfect. No,
there were hard times of learning for her as she stretched the boundaries and
tested the waters like any other kid. But there is no doubt that she was a
precious gift given to us from the most loving Being of all. 

 So if our little girl could rise up out of her circumstances to still praise
God, then why not us too?”

 In only 8 short years, Ava understood what’s taken me so many more years to
stubbornly begin to learn. We don’t get to control what happens to us and we
won’t always like our circumstances. But we can choose to lie down and give up
or we can pick ourselves up and try to joyfully make the most of what we’ve been
given. Whatever setbacks you are facing right now, I hope we can all be like Ava
and choose the latter.

"https://www.facebook.com/jeremylin7/posts/1872374789663787","1482011436","Man... it's been an interesting time since the last time I blogged. Obviously
the most relevant topic is the hamstring, so I'm going to devote this entry to
the injury. When it first happened, I was pretty upset because I felt like we
were turning a corner as a team in terms of figuring out how to play together.
Bringing a new front office, with a new coaching staff, new medical/performance
team and a ton of new players always means there will be growing pains. But I
felt like right before the injury, our team was starting to figure some things
out in terms of style of play, team identity and maximizing players' strengths.

 So when I first got injured, I was pretty pissed. Sadly, when I get pissed, I
comfort eat. So the night of the injury, I had candy and chips (with a side of
Dota 2) for my post-game meal. The first couple weeks of my injury, I devoted to
tracking our offensive possessions. I wanted to figure out which plays/sets were
working the best and with which lineups. I also felt like the injury was an
opportunity for me to really invest and serve my teammates in a different way...
in a more humbling way... from the sidelines. It was difficult at times to
watch, because everything inside me was burning to play. I found myself
frustrated, discouraged and defeated at times.

 Roughly 3 weeks into the injury was when I turned a corner mentally and
spiritually. I realized all my worry and impatience was coming from a place of
fear. Fear that things wouldn't work out the way I wanted them to, that I
wouldn't be able to come back early from injury, that I was letting other people
down and more. So I spent some time praying and reminding myself of some of
God's promises -- that He has a perfect plan, He is 100% in control, I'm exactly
where He wants me to be, His will will be done. This was a huge transition for
me because I could feel myself trusting God more versus trying to control and
micromanage every detail of my rehab process or the team's performance.

 And from there, I got back to truly enjoying the process... even the process of
rehab or cheering on my teammates. I got back to living in the moment and being
thankful for God blessing me with my dream job. And for the most part, I kept
that mindset all the way through to the end of my rehab.

 Now I'm back on the court, and I know there will be more obstacles as I try to
regain my rhythm but I'm excited just to play again! And the injury also taught
me so much about the team. I learned how I can help push each of my teammates
better based on their personality. I also learned what our team needs to improve
in and developed a deeper understanding of the game relative to our system and
personnel. Most importantly, I have a deeper appreciation for my health and the

 I feel fortunate that I come from a family of strong women. One of my
grandmothers earned her medical degree in Asia and then immigrated to the United
States and got her medical license again, in a second language. My other
grandmother raised a family of five after my grandfather passed away when my dad
was young. My mom championed our passion for basketball and learned everything
there was to know about AAU, tournaments, college basketball, and more. Without
her I could never have achieved my dream of playing in the NBA. Today, my female
cousins do important work in the non-profit, public health, and education
sectors and my sister-in-law leads the management of my off-the-court business
and activities.

 I know first-hand how capable women are, and I’ve relied on the women in my
life to help me in so many ways. I’ve also gotten a glimpse into some of the
things that women encounter when they try to succeed – whether its some of the
judgments or stereotypes that they face daily or what society tells them they
should do or be. None of this makes any sense to me. When I look at my nieces,
who are some of the most creative, intelligent and compassionate girls I know, I
hope that they have all the opportunities that boys have growing up.

 Around the world today, girls face many barriers in obtaining an education.
Right now, 32 million girls of lower secondary school age are not enrolled in
school. They are prevented from going to school because of issues like
unaffordable school fees, forced child marriage, and lack of sanitary products.
But we know that if investment is made into girls’ education, their families and
communities benefit. Giving girls equal access to education is one of the best
ways to help break the cycle of poverty.

 That’s why I chose to partner with One Day's Wages on girls’ empowerment and I
hope you will join me in my campaign. When women are empowered, we are all
better off.

a year ago, I was fighting to get cleared for contact right before training
camp. 

 One year ago, I was rehabbing the most devastating injury of my life that took
me out the full season. Two years ago, I was coming off 3 straight injuries that
took me out for almost 60 games. 

 It’s a daily process to regain my form, and I’m not near where I want to be,
but God has tremendously blessed me to be healthy and finish my ninth NBA
regular season!! I wasn’t even supposed to see one! Grateful for the highs, the
lows, the lessons and the fans!

"https://www.facebook.com/jeremylin7/posts/1767868586781075:0","1462489238","After taking a couple of days to process everything from our playoff series, I
just wanted to leave you with a very open and honest note to thank all my
beloved fans. It's the least I can do for all your support this past season.

 Athletes often say ""I have the best fans in the world."" When I say it, I mean
it. You all support me with so much enthusiasm that every year my teammates talk
about how they've never seen such die-hard fans. Sure, sometimes you guys can be
a little aggressive or overwhelming for other fans and reporters haha, but I
understand that comes from your love for me.

 You guys showed up nightly to TWC Arena giving us a huge home court advantage.
You made all of us feel like rock stars on our preseason trip to China. You flew
in from different U.S. cities and countries (some which required ~18 hours of
flying) just to watch regular season games. You guys cared enough about me to
make and share a video of fouls committed on me. I received more gifts, support
letters and fan art than I know what to do with. 

 Over 10,000 of you signed up for my prayer letter and diligently prayed for me
throughout the season. Hundreds of you opened up about some of the most
vulnerable parts of your life and asked me and my business team to pray for you
guys (which we did).

 THANKS for being a big reason why this was the most enjoyable season I've ever
had in the NBA! Sorry we couldn't keep this playoff run going. I'm extremely sad
about this season ending and miss basketball like crazy already. I seriously
can't wait for my body to heal up and start training again. I try not to think
about the playoffs, and turn away when I see any other playoff games. It stings
because I know we could be in the 2nd round, but God is perfect through the
highs and the lows, and He has never led me astray!

 This past year was a step in the right direction, but I know there's another
level I can get to. So as I approach the off-season, I will keep working on my
game. Next year my jumper will be way better. I will come back a much better
player. I want to keep having fun on the court (like I did this past year). For
free agency, I will seek out every opportunity that gives me the greatest chance
to be the best player I can be. I believe I'm just getting started. I have more
to give and more to accomplish. 

 I'm excited to see what God has for me in the future! But for now, time to
rest, recover and recharge myself physically and mentally. So on that note, I'm
off to vacation!!

 P.S had to leave you guys with one last hairdo","1571441688","/jeremylin7/photos/a.1458254571075813/1767868586781075/?type=3&eid=ARD9aVMp7dNJxgh3TmP-_WicDrslW1U3n2Y0Pmz_MLx1IDLmOVT5fQXvpm5GAFou54esEqG91ZbtDP9b&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAyqsoL8jQF-hpQ9PyaGPrnb71r01IMiCV55lij_D7q7dnMBNaYEi4P01YJ2Lr-y9xGGj1ZJKeXH-WWYFxtJ-C8f_jKuDKJu0HCncQv3Voj3QZoXTceDwtUmQphRxj9vO8m4eqjm6DUa7-NGmxAaGmwm_4OR9oDJMihq3wJlPMMqKuc2xRyP3Zxa4BJs_5p3CucjBc40M1I3ZP-hDV_gXu54nB4h-KR486Hxxms7I174VVBGF4CtnuJkUwhct1X7GAb2NIFOELNV1KxwBGLrR8Gg-odUeTdmu9-TkmEq7IZfcWV7_Ai5UHvUogWRhXm_NHLltwe1TFenTT4lNertaRpRKur&__tn__=EEHH-R","https://scontent-sin6-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p526x296/13119854_1767868586781075_7932554568477267907_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&_nc_oc=AQmvHRSzuRYABRmmwpeN8acoZEh5gqkf1MPnl92EH4W2mLckvu2UgZzNlOKG7tJ4aj8&_nc_ht=scontent-sin6-2.xx&oh=ebf111c95034cd3ea3313391647b370b&oe=5E1698F5","undefined","",""
"https://www.facebook.com/jeremylin7/posts/1660507667517168","1436404676","Going into my first true free agency as an NBA player this off-season, the one
thing that mattered to me the most was finding a team that would be a good fit
for me. I wanted to be on a team where I would be able to play freely and truly
play the game I love with joy again. That has always been the most important
thing to me. After a LOT of prayer and long discussions with family and friends,
I wanted to personally let you guys know I'll be joining the Charlotte Hornets. 

 My journey has never looked the way I (or anyone else) thought it would, but
God has always worked things out for my good and I am confident that he will
continue to do so. I want to thank Coach Clifford and the Hornets organization
for this opportunity - for taking the time to talk to me, understanding my game,
and most importantly, making it clear they believe in me. For those of you who
have been patiently waiting for news, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for
joining me on this journey. To the Lakers organization and the city of Los
Angeles, thank you for your support this past season. 

 I have no idea what is coming next, but I promise I will do everything in my
power to contribute to this team and to improve as a player and as a person.
